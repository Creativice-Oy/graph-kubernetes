# Development

Add details here to give a brief overview of how to work with the provider APIs.
Please reference any SDKs or API docs used to help build the integration here.

## Prerequisites

Supply details about software or tooling (like maybe Docker or Terraform) that
is needed for development here.

Please supply references to documentation that details how to install those
dependencies here.

Tools like Node.js and NPM are already covered in the [README](../README.md) so
don't bother documenting that here.

## Provider account setup

There are two ways to install the integration in your Kubernetes cluster, Helm
and raw YAML. You can find the documentation for Helm
[here](../configs/helm/README.md) and the documentation for using raw YAML
[here](../configs/raw/README.md).
